**I'm amazed by people who argue and criticize me with their own thoughts**

- If you are right or wrong it doesn't matter, we win anyway if it's a reasonable argumentation. So just [contact](/contact) me!

**I'm not a Nerd, Geek, or Hipster**

- I like tech, learning, and talking about strange ideas, but I don't really fall into any of the 3. 

- I used to play video games, and watch a lot of anime, movies, and series, but I don't anymore + I never liked academics

**I'm biased toward individualistic liberalism, but I can change my mind**

- I'm trying to fill the gaps in my collectivism to be more whole as a person. 

- I'm more on the liberals side because of my level of mental openness on most stuff. 

- I still think that stability is essential for ordering our minds, but never to put them inside a box.
