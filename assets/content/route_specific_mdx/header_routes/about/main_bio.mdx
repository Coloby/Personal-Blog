I'm a boy from Italy, and I consider myself a [generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist). I have too many [*interests*](/interests) to list them there but some of my favorites are web development, self-improvement, and design. For now :P

I love learning stuff while feeling like a novice. 
If I'm not learning I'm creating something with the stuff I learned, like this website and other [*projects*](/projects).

I'm helping people by sharing my knowledge while [learning in public](). Feel free to [*contact*](/contact) me to get or give me some help! I like to communicate on DMs, this website, and on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/edondigital).
