1. Criticism, feedback, deep dives, and talking about anything related to my interests. 
- Who doesn't? we are more egocentric than we think we are, I like to admit it.
2. Any of your beliefs that goes against mine.
- if you think that's important enough, and that I'm wrong about it, PLEASE text me, let's fight >:)
3. Interesting ideas or topics that's being learnt, created, or shared from you or me
- Ideas > things > people. Not that I think that talking about people it's bad but it's *generally* the least interesting to me
4. Most messages that are considered too long
- Have you ever encountered someone that sends entire paragraphs in a single message? that's me, I love these people.
