I can talk about controversial and contradictory topics, but not the stuff listed below.

1. Small talks or shallow and superficial ones
- Any single one that starts *only* with an opener like: "hi", "hello", "what's up", "good morning/night". Trigghers me even if I don't show it, just don't.
- NO: "wow, today it's raining"
- YES: "wow, today it's raining, do you think I should dance under the rain? could be the start for a drammatic story"
2. Gossip
3. Most memes
4. Drama
