I hate the idea of being employed in a job I hate. So the only solution was to get interested in the whole "money" world. I understood that to get what I want I need people to help me, so how can I convince them ethically to do so? helping them first.

I want to translate what I love to do into a monetary income. Some people say that they don't mind money while their time, relationships, health, and fulfillment depend on money.
