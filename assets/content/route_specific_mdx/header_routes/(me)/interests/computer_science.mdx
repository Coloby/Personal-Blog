### More info
I'm mostly interested in the software section of CS. I don't get the same emotional attachment with the hardware even though one could argue that at least it is "real". If what we perceive can be considered "real" then the question would be "what's not real?". 

I usually don't find much time for this stuff because I have other priorities, and I'm scared of being obsessed with some of its concepts. However, when you are exposed to this world by young it's hard not to be interested.
