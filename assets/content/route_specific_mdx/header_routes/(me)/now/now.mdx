## Updated: 24/Apr/2024
I'll update this section at least 1 time a week

### ðŸ’  What's most important in this period
1. Setting up a minimal arch installation
2. Upgrading this website


### ðŸ’­ Reflecting
#### Why and how to take more responsabilities?
Being reliable is needed for me to achieve my goals, responsabilities are needed to test me out better
#### I have more notes that I can handle
I need to re-study and think about some of my past knowledge
#### Leverages
Things you do to have more outcomes through the same amount of inputs (it's more important than it looks like :P)
