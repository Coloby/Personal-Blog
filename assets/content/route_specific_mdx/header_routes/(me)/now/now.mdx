I'll update this section at least 1 time a week if not more :)

### ðŸ’  What's most important in this period
1. Upgrading this website to learn web development further
2. Sharing knowledge. Especially to develop writing and speaking skills through [articles](/blog), [tweets](https://twitter.com/edondigital), DMs, [discord](https://discord.gg/QyeNQPa3tY), etc


### ðŸ’­ Reflecting
#### Having a mentor, peer, and mentee

#### Leverages
Things you do to have more outcomes through the same amount of inputs (it's more important than this :P)
#### If you need changes, you need to change
Do you need to obtain a goal? what are the best changes in your daily life that you need to implement?
#### Learning in public
Make yourself accountable
#### 4 Activities for fulfillment
Execute - doing what you love through projects

Learn - to never fall behind

Share - to help people, get more fulfillment, etc

Think - about what to do tomorrow to ensure the quality of work
