## Updated: 01/Apr/2024
I'll update this section at least 1 time a week if not more :)

### ðŸ’  What's most important in this period
1. Upgrading this website to learn web development further

### ðŸ’­ Reflecting
#### I have more notes that I can handle
I need to re-study and think about some of my past knowledge
#### How can we get the most from our relationships?
Finding effective ways to grow together
#### Having a mentor, peer, and mentee

#### Leverages
Things you do to have more outcomes through the same amount of inputs (it's more important than it looks like :P)
#### If you need changes, you need to change
Do you need to obtain a goal? what are the best changes in your daily life that you need to implement? chaos is beneficial as much as order.
