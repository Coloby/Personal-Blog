I'll update this section at least 1 time a month

### ðŸ’  What's most important in this period
1. Speedrunning updates for this website
2. Mantaining other areas of my life


### ðŸ’­ Reflecting
#### 8h work-days aren't real, more like "6h" maximum of actual work
- we lose ~35 minutes every 2 hours straight of work, for a total of ~2h20m time lost "working" (5h40m)
- why?
  - random interruptions every 2 hours for 15 minutes
  - loss of productivity after 2 hours straight (needs at least 20m rest or you'll lose even more time being unproductive)
