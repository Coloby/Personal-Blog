**I'm amazed by people who argue and criticize me with their own thoughts**

- If you are right or wrong it doesn't matter, we win anyway if it's a reasonable argumentation.

**I'm not a Nerd, Geek, or Hipster**

- I like tech, learning, and talking about strange ideas, but I don't really fall into any of the 3. 

- I used to play video games, and watch a lot of anime, movies, and series, but I don't anymore + I never liked academics
