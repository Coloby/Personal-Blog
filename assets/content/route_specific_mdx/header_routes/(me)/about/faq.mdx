**What about the visuals?**

- It's a combination of aesthetics like vaporwave, outrun, and cyberpunk. Here's a [handy graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/comments/7yh801/cyberpunk_vs_outrun_vs_vaporwave/) for a better understanding.

- I will mix some other styles with time, but outrun and cyberpunk will probably be the most dominant.

**Why the swag cat?**

- I love the internet because I used it from a young age, and I consider cats as a great visual representation of it :P. 

- [They are pretty stylish](https://www.pinterest.it/pin/620230179961213204/), so share some great imagery of them! 

- I don't have a cat nor I'm thinking of having one at the moment.

**What is your real name, age, and birthday?**

- Just call me Ed, don't worry about anything else B) 

**Why are you spamming emoticons?**

- Because they are amazing   >:D   and I don't like emojis

**What languages can you speak?**

- Native italian and kinda* fluent english. I'm still searching for important motivations to study other languages.
