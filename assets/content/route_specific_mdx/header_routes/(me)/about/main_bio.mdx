I'm a guy from Italy, and I consider myself a [generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist). 

I'm always learning while creating projects, and I have too many interests to list them there. 

I'm mostly knowledgeable about computer stuff, but also intrigued about more creative endeavors.

I like to help people by sharing my knowledge.

Feel free to [*contact*](/contact) me to get or give me some help!
