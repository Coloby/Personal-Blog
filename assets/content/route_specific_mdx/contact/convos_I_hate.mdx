I can talk about controversial and contradictory topics, but not the stuff listed below.

1. Small talks or shallow and superficial ones
- Any single one that starts *only* with an opener like: "hi", "hello", "what's up", "good morning/night". Are you even trying to have a chat?
- NO: "wow, today it's raining"
- YES: "wow, today it's raining. Do you think I should dance under the rain?"
2. Drama
3. Gossip
