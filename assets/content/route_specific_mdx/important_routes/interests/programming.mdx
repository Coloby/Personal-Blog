### More info

I can't remember when I started but I'm sure enough that at least 2 years have passed. I'm studying it more seriously only by 5 months. I love javascript because it's versatile and I can use it in many scenarios, the bread and butter for a generalist like me.

I also tried other languages like C and Python but I always came back to javascript. I love the feeling of creating something mine in the digital world since I was there at a very young age.
