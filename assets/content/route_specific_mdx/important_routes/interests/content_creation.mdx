Started almost 3 months ago. I started only recently but this wasn't something new at all to me. I hated social media, thought that you had to be really famous to gain anything from it, and that "I wasn't ready" because I didn't do anything "special". Luckily curiosity got the best of me and I searched for many points of view to evaluate these beliefs.

I made a list of pros and cons and, to my surprise, I only had a few cons compared to the multitude of pros I found. So I started small and now I try to help people as much as I can with what I love to do.
